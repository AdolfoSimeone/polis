\f0\b0\fs36 \cf0 IRAN has returned to the front pages after a summer hiatus. Negotiations aimed at preventing the dreaded Persian Bomb have resumed their desultory course. Iran, although suffering from the international sanctions choreographed by the Obama administration, keeps adding new arrays of centrifuges while insisting the program is strictly nonmilitary. Israel is \'97 or maybe isn\'92t \'97 edging closer to a unilateral strike. The U.S., we learn from The Times\'92s reliable David Sanger, is considering more and bigger bouts of cybersabotage. Meanwhile, the mullahs are shipping arms to their embattled fellow despots in Syria.\
This strikes me as a good time to address an unnerving question that confronts any concerned student of this subject: Can we live with a nuclear Iran? Given a choice of raining bunker-busting munitions on Iran\'92s underground enrichment facilities, or, alternatively, containing a nuclear-armed Iran with the sobering threat of annihilation, which is the less bad option? As the slogan goes in Israel: \'93Bomb? Or The Bomb?\'94\
The prevailing view now is that a nuclear Iran cannot be safely contained. On this point both {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wjla.com/articles/2012/03/obama-unacceptable-for-iran-to-have-nuclear-weapon--73286.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 President Obama}} and{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57500225/romney-nuclear-iran-unacceptable/"}}{\fldrslt \cf3  Mitt Romney }}agree. They can hardly say otherwise; to even hint that a nuclear Iran is acceptable would undermine the efforts aimed at preventing that outcome. But I tend to think they mean it.\
However, there are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2011/RAND_MG1154.pdf"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 serious}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66032/james-m-lindsay-and-ray-takeyh/after-iran-gets-the-bomb"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 thoughtful}} {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://tcf.org/publications/pdfs/pb596/posen_nuclear-armed.pdf"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 people}} {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.npr.org/2012/03/06/148053976/weighing-a-policy-of-containment-for-iran"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 who are willing}} to contemplate a nuclear Iran, kept in check by the time-tested assurance of retaliatory destruction. If the U.S. arsenal deterred the Soviet Union for decades of cold war and now keeps North Korea\'92s nukes in their silos, if India and Pakistan have kept each other in a nuclear stalemate, why would Iran not be similarly deterred by the certainty that using nuclear weapons would bring a hellish reprisal?\
Anyone who has a glib answer to this problem isn\'92t taking the subject seriously. Personally, I\'92ve tended to duck it, taking refuge in the hope that the tightening vise of international pressure \'97 and a few cyberattacks \'97 would make Iran relent and spare us the hard choice. But that could be wishful thinking. So I\'92ve spent some time reading and questioning, trying to report my way to an opinion.\
Let\'92s assume, for starters, that Iran\'92s theocrats are determined to acquire nuclear weapons. Western analysts say there is no evidence yet that the supreme leader has made that decision. But if you ruled a country surrounded by unfriendly neighbors \'97 Persians among the Arabs, Shiites among the Sunnis \'97 a country with a grand sense of self-esteem, a tendency to paranoia and five nuclear powers nearby, wouldn\'92t you want the security of your own nuclear arsenal?\
Let\'92s assume further that diplomacy, sanctions and computer viruses may not dissuade the regime from its nuclear ambitions. So far, these measures seem to have slowed the nuclear program and bought some time, but Iran\'92s stockpiles of enriched fuel have grown in size and concentration despite everything a disapproving world has thrown at them so far. So, then what?\
A pre-emptive bombing campaign against Iran\'92s uranium factories would almost certainly require major U.S. participation to be effective, and would not be neat. Beyond the immediate casualties, it would carry grave costs: outraged Iranians rallying behind this regime that is now deservedly unpopular; Iran or its surrogates lashing out against American and Israeli targets in a long-term, low-intensity campaign of retaliation; a scorching hatred of America on the newly empowered Arab street, generating new recruits for Al Qaeda and its ilk; an untimely oil shock to a fragile world economy; an unraveling of the united front Obama has assembled to isolate Iran. All that, and a redoubled determination by Iran\'92s leaders to do the one thing that would prevent a future attack: rebuild the nuclear assembly line, only this time faster and deeper underground. There is a pretty broad consensus that, short of a full-scale invasion and occupation of Iran, a preventive attack would not end the nuclear program, only postpone it for a few years.\
Now imagine that Iran succeeds in making its way into the nuclear club.\
Despite the incendiary rhetoric, it is hard to believe the aim of an Iranian nuclear program is the extermination of Israel. The regime in Iran is brutal, mendacious and meddlesome, and given to spraying gobbets of Hitleresque bile at the Jewish state. But Israel is a nuclear power, backed by a bigger nuclear power. Before an Iranian mushroom cloud had bloomed to its full height over Tel Aviv, a flock of reciprocal nukes would be on the way to incinerate Iran. Iran may encourage fanatic chumps to carry out suicide missions, but there is not the slightest reason to believe the mullahs themselves are suicidal.\
The more common arguments against tolerating a nuclear Iran are these:\
First, that possession of a nuclear shield would embolden Iran to step up its interference in the region, either directly or through surrogates like Hezbollah. This is probably true. But as James Dobbins, a former diplomat who heads security studies for the RAND Corporation, told me, the subversive menace of a nuclear Iran has to be weighed against the lethal rage of an Iran that had been the victim of an unprovoked attack.\
A second worry is that a Persian Bomb would set off a regional nuclear arms race. This is probably an exaggerated fear. A nuclear program is not cheap or easy. In other parts of the world, the proliferation virus has not been as contagious as you might have feared. So the Saudis, who regard Iran as a viper state, might be tempted buy a bomb from Pakistan, which is not a pleasant thought. But Egypt (broke), Turkey (a NATO member) and the others have strong reasons not to join the race.\
Most worrisome, I think, is the danger that a crisis between Israel and Iran would escalate out of control. Given the history of mistrust and the absence of communication, some war planner on one side or the other might guess that a nuclear attack was imminent, and decide to go first.\
\'93You would have a very unstable deterrent environment between Israel and Iran, simply because these are two states that tend to view each other in existential terms,\'94 said Ray Takeyh, an Iranian-American Middle East scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, who is not an advocate of containment. Against this fear, history suggests that nuclear weapons make even aggressive countries more cautious. Before their first nuclear tests, India and Pakistan fought three serious conventional wars. Since getting their nukes they have bristled at each other across a long, heavily armed border, but no dispute has risen to an outright war.\
At the end of this theoretical exercise, we have two awful choices with unpredictable consequences. After immersing myself in the expert thinking on both sides, I think that, forced to choose, I would swallow hard and take the risks of a nuclear Iran over the gamble of a pre-emptive war. My view may be colored by a bit of post-Iraq syndrome.\
What statesmen do when faced with bad options is create new ones. The third choice in this case is to negotiate a deal that lets Iran enrich uranium for civilian use (as it is entitled to do under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty), that applies rigorous safeguards (because Iran cheats), that gradually relaxes sanctions and brings this wayward country into the community of more-or-less civilized nations.\
That, of course, won\'92t happen before November. Any U.S. concession now would be decried by Republicans as an abandonment of Israel and a reward to a government that recently beat a democracy movement bloody. We can only hope that after the election we get some braver, more creative diplomacy, either from a liberated Obama or (hope springs eternal) a President Romney who has a Nixon-to-China moment.\
Because a frank look at the alternatives of (a) pre-emptive war and (b) a nuclear Iran should be enough to focus all of our intelligence and energy on (c) none of the above.\

\f0\fs30 \cf0 Would Iran really launch such a weapon? Wrap your mind around these words delivered by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Israel's milestone, 60th birthday in 2008:
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 "Those who think they can revive the stinking corpse of the usurping and fake Israeli regime by throwing a birthday party are seriously mistaken. Today, the reason for the Zionist regime's existence is questioned, and this regime is on its way to annihilation. They should know that regional nations hate this fake and criminal regime and if the smallest and briefest chance is given to regional nations they will destroy it."
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232

\f0\fs30 \cf0 Bill Keller says the mullahs are rational, which suggests we should trust them when they have nukes. But was it rational to sacrifice a generation of young boys during the Iran-Iraq war by having them repeatedly cross mine fields as human detectors forced to march ahead of Iran's military? is it rational to send agents half way across the globe to places like Buenos Aires to blow up Jews? Is it rational for an observer sitting in New York to believe, on the one hand, that the mullahs are truthful when they say their nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes, but that it is hard to believe, on the other hand, that they mean what they say when characterizing Israel as a cancer that must be eliminated? Wordsmith Bill Keller must have intended to use the word "rationalize" rather than "rational" to explain how desperate many are to accommodate a nuclear Iran. That's a lot easier to do sitting in New York rather than Jerusalem, Riyadh, Baku and other capitals in Tehran's neighborhood.\

\f0\fs30 \cf0 Mr. Keller has presented a thoughtful, logical argument that a world living with a nuclear-armed Iran would be better than one after a pre-emptive U.S. and/or Israeli strike to take out Iran's nuclear capability. In fact, I think he has weakened, if not demolished, the alarmist cries from some Israelis and some Americans that a nuclear Iran is, ipso facto, unacceptable because it would lead inevitably to Israel's annihilation and an Iran on the rampage in support of radical Islam. The first assumption is far from the given that that some make it out to be, but the second would undoubtedly be the consequence of a pre-emptive strike--and Iran would occupy the moral high ground. 
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 The other "given" is that a military attack, whatever its initial success, would not by any means put an end to Iran's nuclear ambitions.
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 All the above is the reason that some of Mr. Keller's strongest allies in arguing against an Israeli strike are current and former leaders of Israel's security and intelligence establishment. They have become Prime Minister Netanyahu's strongest critics. Why America's media continue to ignore that Israeli consensus escapes me.\

\f0\fs30 \cf0 Hmmm ... I wonder if Mr. Keller is related to John Boehner or Harry Reid? I ask because his 'solution' appears to be simply to kick the can down the road. Any serious student of history understands that to be the most dangerous alternative as it abandons control of events to the winds of fate.
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 Mr. Keller's analysis of the distastefulness of the available alternatives is spot-on but that does not suggest that treading water is a better choice. That course is likely to result in fewer alternatives and far more limited maneuvering room when can-kicking is no longer possible and all of the initiative rests with Iran.\

\f0\fs30 \cf0 At last, some common sense on this issue. I have never understood all of the fear-mongering about a nuclear Iran. There seems to be a general assumption that the lunacy among Iran's rulers, combined with nuclear weapons, would lead to disaster all around, particularly for Israel. But the Iranians have shown themselves to be calculating, rational, opponents. Any use of nuclear weapons on their part would lead to the destruction of Iran in retaliation. The idea that they would ignore these consequences and pursue mutual destruction anyway is a weak one. On the other hand, a preemptive strike at Iran would drag the US into a prolonged war, both overt and covert. We played the waiting game with the Soviet Union for many years, and it proved to be the right choice. I hope the leaders of the US and Israel make the right choice this time as well.\

\f0\fs30 \cf0 I suspect that you are correct in your analysis. The fact is that Iran's logic for seeking nuclear capabilities is not that different from what drove Israel's ambitions. Iran views itself as surrounded by adversaries, several of whom have nuclear weapons, and so sees a vital need to have the same capability. Frankly, I do not see how we can prevent this. Delay it, yes, but prevention would involve destroying capabilities on the ground, which means war.
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 No country has ever used nuclear weapons against a country capable of retaliating. We were certainly not thrilled to see such weapons in the hands of the Soviets, but we learned to live with the bomb. I would expect the same to be true for Iran.
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 So while a despotic regime with nuclear capabilities is hardly ideal, we have successfully lived with this situation for decades. And attacking Iran will only delay the fall of the current regime which is really the overarching concern.
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 Despotic regimes are ultimately unsustainable. In the modern era, they appear to last around 70-80 years at best (which leaves the mullahs another couple of decades). So it seems to me that our choices are: a) total war for regime change now (think how well Iraq worked out), b) limited war that turns the Iranian people against us and bolsters the mullahs, or c) containment until the day the Iranian people take destiny into their own hands.
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232

This means that along with demanding that Iran not develop a nuclear weapons capability, we should be demanding that Israel and Pakistan destroy their nuclear weapons. But should Iran build a nuclear bomb, it would not be the end of the world. It is not worth my son's life, or the life of any mother's son or daughter, to prevent this from happening.\

\f0\fs30 \cf0 Containing a nuclear Iran will be no more difficult and probably far less a real issue than containing a nuclear Pakistan which the west has been doing for a generation. The Pakistani government is as volatile and the population far more anti-US than Iran. I have family in Iran and have regular contact. The Iranian people are as afraid of nukes as any one else. 
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 The Iranian government has no more desire to use nukes on its neighbors than the Israelis or the Pakistanis. They know that it is not the use of the weapons, but the possession of them that gives them the deterrent status and negotiation handle.
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 Their involvement in the Syrian conflict, having 2 million Afghan refugees inside their own border, and their being the lead Shiite nation in the region makes then a natural target for all the Sunni Arab states which are far different than the Persians in culture, language and, more importantly, in military might. Iran' government is also far more under the influence of Russia and China even though the vast majority of their young population is favorable towards the west and the US. But that would end in a blink if the US strikes at their nuclear facilities.\

\f0\fs36 \cf0 \cb8 Kudos to Bill Keller for his superb analysis of the ramifications if Iran acquires nuclear weapons (\'93{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/opinion/keller-nuclear-mullahs.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 Nuclear Mullahs}},\'94 column, Sept. 10).\
As he points out, given Israel\'92s enormous military superiority, an Iranian bomb would likely not be a threat to Israel\'92s national security. The slightest indication that Iran intended to use the bomb would trigger an instant and devastating Israeli pre-emptive attack.\
The downside of a military attack is overwhelming. A military assault would most certainly drag America into the conflict. Iranian \'97 and regional \'97 reaction would be catastrophic for American and Western interests. Iran would unquestionably launch a multifront military and terrorist reaction. American lives would most surely be endangered worldwide.\
Finally, most military strategists agree that even a prolonged air campaign would set the Iranian program back by only a few years. Mr. Keller deserves our gratitude for heroically standing up to the unrelenting beating of war drums by the Israeli leadership.\

\f0\fs36 \cf0 \cb8 Bill Keller\'92s analysis of containing a nuclear-armed Iran suffers from a glaring omission: He did not address the possibility that an Iranian nuke might fall into terrorists\'92 hands. The Iranian regime could deliberately arm a terrorist cell, or terrorists could exploit Iran\'92s inferior security infrastructure to steal a weapon, or an unstable future Iran could collapse, leaving its stockpile vulnerable.\
How, then, would the United States know where to direct its \'93flock of reciprocal nukes\'94 before the mushroom cloud swallowed Tel Aviv, or Manhattan? Even if the detonated bomb could be traced to Iran, the damage would be done.\
The potential destruction of another state will not deter a rogue group, let alone one of eager would-be martyrs. We also mustn\'92t forget that while America stakes its military strategy on such an optimistic gamble, Israel stakes its existence.\

\f0\fs36 \cf0 \cb8 Bill Keller makes a compelling case that it is better to tolerate a nuclear Iran than endure all the horrific consequences that a military strike would produce. He assures us that Iran is not likely to launch a nuclear attack against Israel, knowing that it would be suicidal, and that its threats to wipe Israel off the map are just words.\
Mr. Keller may be correct, but what if he is mistaken? How can Israeli leaders who are even 90 percent certain that deterrence will work allow their citizens to be subject to a second Holocaust, knowing that this time the Jewish people have the means to stop it?\
In a nuclear Iran, accidents, miscalculations, unauthorized launchings or the dying gasps of a beleaguered regime could each mean the end of Israel. Maybe Mr. Keller is right that the prudent course for Israel (and the United States) is to allow Iran to acquire nuclear arms. But if Israel or the United States does strike to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons, it will have ample justification to do so.\

\f0\fs36 \cf0 \cb8 Bill Keller thoughtfully tempers the worst fears about a nuclear-armed Iran. And he is certainly correct that Iran would be deterred from directly using nuclear weapons because of the threat of retaliation.\
But he plays down what would likely be the most destabilizing and dangerous impact of a nuclear Iran: Tehran\'92s use of its arsenal as a protective shield while it expanded power and influence across the region.\
Mr. Keller says this \'93nuclear shield\'94 would mostly just embolden Iran\'92s support for subversive proxies like Hezbollah. But with territorial (and other) disputes against nearly all of its neighbors, Iran could also use a nuclear deterrent to try to alter the map of the Middle East.\
This is not simply an idle hypothetical: If Saddam Hussein had nuclear weapons in the summer of 1990, Kuwait would most likely now be part of Iraq.\
The United States and its allies cannot allow Iran such a waiver to engage in reckless aggression. Perhaps if that became clear, Iran would finally think twice about proceeding with its nuclear ambitions.\

\f0\fs30 \cf10 \cb8 The past several months have witnessed a heated debate over the best way for the United States and Israel to respond to Iran's nuclear activities. As the argument has raged, the United States has tightened its already robust sanctions regime against the Islamic Republic, and the European Union announced in January that it will begin an embargo on Iranian oil on July 1. Although the United States, the EU, and Iran have recently returned to the negotiating table, a palpable sense of crisis still looms.\'a0\
It should not. Most U.S., European, and Israeli commentators and policymakers warn that a nuclear-armed Iran would be the worst possible outcome of the current standoff. In fact, it would probably be the best possible result: the one most likely to restore stability to the Middle East.\'a0\
POWER BEGS TO BE BALANCED\
The crisis over Iran's nuclear program could end in three different ways. First, diplomacy coupled with serious sanctions could convince Iran to abandon its pursuit of a nuclear weapon. But this outcome is unlikely: the historical record indicates that a country bent on acquiring nuclear weapons can rarely be dissuaded from doing so. Punishing a state through economic sanctions does not inexorably derail its nuclear program. Take North Korea, which succeeded in building its weapons despite countless rounds\'a0of sanctions and UN Security Council resolutions. If Tehran determines that its security depends on possessing nuclear weapons, sanctions are unlikely to change its mind. In fact, adding still more sanctions now could make Iran feel even more vulnerable, giving it still more reason to seek the protection of the ultimate deterrent.\'a0\
The second possible outcome is that Iran stops short of testing a nuclear weapon but develops a breakout capability, the capacity to build and test one quite quickly. Iran would not be the first country to acquire a sophisticated nuclear program without building an actual bomb. Japan, for instance, maintains a vast civilian nuclear infrastructure. Experts believe that it could produce a nuclear weapon on short notice.\'a0\

\fs28 \cf15 I am very surprised by Waltz's assumptions and conclusions in this article. If one were going to argue that Iran should be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon, one should use much better rationale to do so.\
My initial shock stems from the fact that Mr. Waltz actually seems to believe that Iran is a state just like any other. That they have rationallity and long-term stability in their present, as well as in their future. I would argue that this is not the case at all. There are significant power struggles happening within the country - between political factions, as well as between the Ayatollas and the politicians. In addition to that, the populace is not the contented entity that his article assumes. The reaction after the elections a couple years ago, along with the response of the regime underscore this.\
In addition, Iran has been very willing in the past - and possibly in the present - to make use of terrorist organizations to do their dirty work. Iran has worked through and with both Hamas and Hezbollah. Disavowal of these types of activities have been long in coming, did I miss them? Or are we still waiting? Ah yes, still waiting. The idea that a handoff of nukes to these organizations would be known in time, or not done because the weapons are expensive is fantasy. Iran doesn't play by those rules.\
Waltz's assertion that countries attaining nuclear capability tend to reduce imbalances in military power is specious, seeing as the other countries joining the nuclear club have NOT been Iran. Lumping this country with others from the past is a bit like saying that a strain of bird flu with mutations is bird flu like we have encountered elsewhere in the world. Iran is a country like other countries, yet Iran with nuclear weapons is an unknown entity that has in the past threatened various European powers, the United States, and Israel. Acting as though the country will not use these weapons if they are attained is whistling past the graveyard.\
As for the balance of power in the region, despite the fact that the weapons in Turkey are NATO nukes, there is a balancing aspect to their control of them. Turkey, although not aligned with Iran as Syria is, has an Islamist government which has a role in NATO as well as at the UN. The country has influence with the US and the world through these ties. And finally, Iran is a state protected by Russia - and to a lesser extent China - on the world stage. Both these countries have nuclear weapons that can be considered to balance Israel's arsenal.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl440
\cf15 I fear Mr. Waltz is mistaken in his assumptions as well as his conclusion that Iran should not be disallowed from attaining nuclear weapons. He seems to have a very rosey view of the matter.\

\fs28 \cf15 I can\'92t agree with this argument because of two reasons.\
First, this idea regards the handoff to terrorists as improbable. But not a few of them are much eager to acquire the atomic bombs because it enables them to wound the "Trunk". The threat of nuclear proliferation originates in the simplicity of weaponizing. Anyone who gets the high enriched uranium can make the bombs. Imagine the people in China or Russia who resort to the suitcase bomb for protesting against the regime. Loose nuclear management triggers the world unacceptable vulnerability.\
Second, this notice admit the possession of nuclear weapons politically. But the hypotheses of NPT regime demand that no country can develop nuclear weapons because it is a necessary evil. The status is dramatically different, political measure from evil. This concession denies NPT regime, which is unprecedented.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl440
\cf15 Finally, power begs to be balanced or to avoid massive disaster; that is the question. Accounting for the lack of Israel\'92s geographical depth, the current status is balancing. Even if rebalancing is required, we should seek another way. Japan decides not to develop nuclear weapons because it knows that isolationism is not the way to prosperity. Isolationism stiffens the foreign policy unpredictably, as Japan once experienced in 1930s. I\'92d like to say to Iranian people; Take handle while you can choose your course.\

Israel has defended herself well, but she does not talk about wiping out any Islamic nation as they freely threaten to wipe out Israel.\
Israel is the target now because Islamic nations have the power of oil, but are still in flux. As they acquire physical power, their focus will change to America, which is the great Western power.\

Moral equivalence, especially where Israel is involved, is just another way to surrender to Islamists.

\fs28 \cf15 There is something of an appeasement, "peace at any price" core to Kenneth Waltz\'92s shocking assertion that we should just let Iran build nukes. Yes, the road to stopping Iran\'92s nuclear ambitions will not be easy and it will come at a price in human lives and financial resources. However, Waltz\'92s suggestion of a Nuclear Shiite Iran \'96 one with a regime that believes in a better life after death \'96 creating stability in the Middle East that is simply ridiculous on the surface and then considerably less funny when one truly digs into the issue. There\'92s no point in comparing Iran with the China/India/Pakistan situation because they are completely different. Yes, all have funded terrorist organizations to varying degrees -- largely for political and financial purposes rather than ideological ones -- and Pakistan still looms as a far greater danger than either China or India \'96 and a Pakistani-Iranian alliance would indeed be a substantial danger. But at the moment the new \'93Persian Empire\'94 as the Iranian Mullahs frequently like to refer to themselves (although not in public forums) is determined to export its radical views of Islam not only throughout the region but throughout the world. To even attempt to compare a nuclear-armed Iran vs. Israel scenario as stabilizing is absurd. Israel built a bomb because it had seven million citizens facing some HUNDRED MILLION in hostile Islamic countries. Moreover, even setting Israel aside, how does Waltz explain what the Saudis and their Sunni allies will do? And we must make no mistake that the Shiite-Sunni rivalry is every bit as dangerous as Iran\'92s designs on Israel. Let\'92s make this simple: Can you trust a country that sends assassins to kill journalists in the Netherlands after they wrote cartoons about Islam? That\'92s how Waltz defines stability?\

\fs28 \cf0 Although Israel has been at the fore of nuclear deterrence in Iran, this article only captured half, or perhaps two thirds, of the power-struggle revolving around this issue in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia has also made clear that it does not want to see a nuclear armed Iran emerge, and that in such a case, it would seek nuclear weapons as well.\
The author of this article makes an interesting case, regarding the balancing affect of nuclear weapons, yet he neglects to note that despite acquiring nuclear weapons, India and Pakistan have not ceased hostilities (i.e. Mumbai massacre), or the demilitarization of Kashmir. North Korea, as well, has taken lethal action against the South, despite their MAD deterrence. While these instances are far from full fledged war, they are certainly worth consideration, though it is true, perhaps MAD did prevent the outbreak of further bloodshed. However, with a steady flow of blood already flowing in the Middle East, such an effect is more doubtable.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl440\ql\qnatural
\cf0 Irans proxy wars, being waged in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, as well, would, indeed, only be emboldened by a nuclear armed Iran. Such an accomplishment would serve as a certain propaganda/morale feat, while giving the Iranian Gov.'t a certain level of insurance that overt, exterior retaliation against it could be avoided for its proxy efforts in regional countries. With a Sunni-Shia conflict unfolding in Syria, Saudi Arabia, and other gulf states, should have been taken into consideration, in this article, along with Israel.\

\fs28 \cf0 An interesting outline of a view very different from my own.\
I wonder if the author remembers\'a0Ahmadinejad's letter to Angela Merkel where he applauded Germany for their particular efforts with the Jewish people during the last of the great wars? Much 'rational' argument was passed back and forth \'a0in the days before the war to assess or play down the danger of Hitler. Most notably was Prime Minister of the UK, Mr Chamberlain's peace negotiations with Hitler. The ruling Labour Party of my own little Scandinavian country didn't think there were any danger neither, and we therefore had practically no defences when Hitler struck.\
Where rationale is influenced to such a degree by beliefs, that self-destruction gives you advancement in Heaven's halls for eternity, pure logic looses its bite. I hope it's not too hard to remember across the Atlantic that hatred against Jews has found several seemingly irrational, but very tangible outlets, such as the Holocaust. In spite of a well formulated view-point, I find no trace of such understanding in the author. I would hate to live in a world where millions of Jews or people of any other race needed to pay with their lives for our academic experiments. On the other hand, I agree with the author that a hard line sometimes begets a hard response. But this works, and should work both ways.\
Like some of the other commenters have pointed out, the article does not explore the responses of Saudi Arabia and a whole host of other countries in the region. Nor does it explore potential global alliances between a new breed of nuclear superpowers, which would render their combined powers anything but regional. Hence, the article feels like work-in-progress rather than a completed argument.\

\f0\b\fs58 \cf0 \cb1 Israeli Sharpens Call for United States to Set Iran Trigger\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl360\sa40\ql\qnatural

\f1\fs30 \cf2 By {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/david_e_sanger/index.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 DAVID E. SANGER}} and ISABEL KERSHNER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\sa360\ql\qnatural

\f0\b0\fs36 \cf0 WASHINGTON \'97 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel inserted himself into the most contentious foreign policy issue of the American presidential campaign on Tuesday, criticizing the Obama administration for refusing to set clear \'93red lines\'94 on Iran\'92s nuclear progress that would prompt the United States to undertake a military strike. As a result, he said, the administration has no \'93moral right\'94 to restrain Israel from taking military action of its own.\
Mr. Netanyahu\'92s unusually harsh public comments about Israel\'92s most important ally, which closely track what he has reportedly said in vivid terms to American officials visiting Jerusalem, laid bare the tension between him and President Obama over how to handle Iran. They also suggested that he is willing to use the pressure of the presidential election to try to force Mr. Obama to commit to attack Iran under certain conditions.\
He appeared to be responding to a weekend statement by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that the United States was \'93not setting deadlines\'94 beyond which it would turn to a military solution.\
Mr. Netanyahu, speaking at a news conference in Jerusalem, said, \'93Those in the international community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don\'92t have a moral right to place a red light before Israel.\'94\
In another sign of tensions, the Israeli Embassy in Washington said late Tuesday that the Obama administration had declined a request from Mr. Netanyahu\'92s office for a meeting with Mr. Obama when the Israeli leader attends the United Nations General Assembly this month. The Obama administration said the decision was due to a scheduling problem and had been conveyed to Israel long ago.\
On Tuesday night, Mr. Obama called Mr. Netanyahu to try to calm the situation. The two talked for a full hour, hashing through the Iran confrontation and their misunderstandings.\
\'93President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu reaffirmed that they are united in their determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and agreed to continue their close consultations going forward,\'94 the White House said in a statement after the phone call.\
The White House also tried to tamp down controversy over the request for a meeting, saying that after a possible New York encounter was ruled out, Mr. Netanyahu did not request a meeting in Washington. \'93Contrary to reports in the press, there was never a request for Prime Minister Netanyahu to meet with President Obama in Washington, nor was a request for a meeting ever denied,\'94 the statement said.\
The United States says it has no evidence that Iranian leaders have made a final decision to build a bomb. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency\'92s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/world/middleeast/report-on-iran-nuclear-work-puts-israel-in-a-box.html?pagewanted=all"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 latest report}} says the country has amassed a stockpile of low- and medium-enriched uranium that, with further enrichment, could fuel as many as six nuclear weapons.\
The United States concluded several years ago that Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons development program at the end of 2003, though there has been evidence of sporadic work since. The Israelis say Iran is quietly reconstituting a much larger effort.\
In demanding that Mr. Obama effectively issue an ultimatum to Iran, Mr. Netanyahu appeared to be making maximum use of his political leverage at a time when Mr. Obama\'92s Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, has sought to make an issue of what Mr. Romney says is the administration\'92s lack of support for Israel.\
It is not clear what level of development in Iran\'92s nuclear program would constitute a \'93red line\'94 in Israeli eyes. Dore Gold, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, a research institute, and a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, said in an interview last week, \'93It is very important to draw a line about the quantities of enriched uranium and the levels of enrichment.\'94\
One option that has been widely discussed among experts advising the United States government is capping Iran\'92s uranium enrichment at a reactor-grade level. Also, Iran would be permitted to stockpile no more than 1,764 pounds of that uranium, less than is required, if further enriched, to make a single bomb.\
Mr. Netanyahu, who is highly attuned to American politics, seemed to be using his comments to pressure Mr. Obama to specify at which point the United States would be prepared to take military action against Iran, perhaps at the United Nations General Assembly opening this month.\
The Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael B. Oren, echoed Mr. Netanyahu in an interview in Washington on Monday night and said the Israeli leadership wanted Mr. Obama and the leaders of other nations to agree on clear limits for Iran.\
\'93We know that the Iranians see red,\'94 Mr. Oren said. \'93We know they can discern the color red. We know that the redder the line, the lesser the chance that they will pass it.\'94\
Mrs. Clinton publicly rejected that approach over the weekend. In an interview with Bloomberg Radio, she avoided discussion of Iran\'92s stockpile and said, \'93We\'92re not setting deadlines\'94 for military action. It was that statement that appeared to have set off Mr. Netanyahu.\
Mr. Obama has repeatedly argued \'97 with the support of some leading Israeli officials \'97 that the United States and Israel have closer security cooperation now than at any other point in history. The United States provided much of the Iron Dome missile defense system for Israel, and for the past five years the two countries worked closely on a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html?pagewanted=all"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 major covert operation}} against Iran called \'93Olympic Games,\'94 an effort to sabotage Iran\'92s enrichment capability with cyberattacks.\
But Mr. Obama has stopped well short of saying he would prevent Iran from developing the capability to produce a bomb. He has said only that he would not allow Iran to obtain a weapon; Mr. Netanyahu has said that is not enough.\
Depending on how one defines the term, Mr. Obama\'92s aides and former aides acknowledge that Iran may already have that capability. It possesses the fuel and the knowledge to make a weapon, but that would take months or years, and Mr. Obama has argued that allows \'93time and space\'94 for a negotiated solution.\
Mr. Romney had no immediate comment about Mr. Netanyahu\'92s challenge to Mr. Obama, and one of his informal advisers on the Middle East said, \'93It\'92s probably better at this point to let Netanyahu make the point because it\'92s more powerful that way.\'94 The adviser said he was not authorized to speak on the record.\
But the Netanyahu comments play right to the Republican nominee\'92s critique of Mr. Obama. On \'93Meet the Press\'94 on Sunday, Mr. Romney declared that the progress of Iran\'92s nuclear program was Mr. Obama\'92s \'93greatest failure\'94 in foreign policy.\
\'93The president hasn\'92t drawn us any further away from a nuclear Iran,\'94 he said.\
There is little doubt that the Iranian effort has progressed. When Mr. Obama took office, Iran had produced enough fuel to make, if enriched further, about one bomb, compared with five or six in the International Atomic Energy Agency\'92s current calculation.\
But Mr. Romney\'92s proposals have also steered clear of describing with any precision how far Iran could go before he would use force to stop its program. Like Mr. Obama, he has not said how much progress he would allow Iran to make toward a weapons capability before he authorized a strike.\
Instead, he has insisted that Mr. Obama was late to the task of placing \'93crippling sanctions\'94 on Iran. Yet those sanctions have begun to strike at the heart of Iran\'92s greatest source of national revenue \'97 oil sales \'97 something that the Bush administration shied away from.\
Mr. Netanyahu has been dismissive of sanctions. They are an indirect form of pressure, he has argued, and have not forced Iran\'92s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to scale back the country\'92s nuclear program.\
In recent days, the Israelis had appeared to be dialing down the pressure on Washington, with the Israeli news media reporting that Ehud Barak, the defense minister, was rethinking the wisdom of an attack in the coming months. There was speculation that Israeli officials feared that the long-term jeopardy to Israel\'92s relationship with Washington was not worth the short-term gain of setting back, but probably not destroying, Iran\'92s capability.\
A number of American officials, in trips to Israel, have argued that an Israeli attack would only drive the nuclear program underground and most likely result in the expulsion of international inspectors, who are the best gauge of the program\'92s progress.\
But Mr. Netanyahu revived the tough talk of the past few months and the message that time is running out for Israel.\
\'93So far, we can say with certainty that diplomacy and sanctions haven\'92t worked. The sanctions have hurt the Iranian economy, but they haven\'92t stopped the Iranian nuclear program,\'94 Mr. Netanyahu said, adding, \'93The fact is that every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear bombs.\'94\

\f0\fs30 \cf0 Netanyahu really is intent on helping his friend, Romney, win the White House. In so doing, he is intentionally interfering in domestic U.S. politics--a wholly inappropriate act for a foreign leader, especially one which deems itself an "ally". If Netanyahu (ethically compromised already as the record show) and Romney (a man with so little faith in America that he deposits large sums of money off shore) feel that their perception of Israel's security (which is all it is--a perception) trumps the larger issue of U.S. and global security, I'll trust the leader (Obama) who has neither of these marks against him and who has already amply demonstrated that he is willing and able to take the necessary steps when the time is right.

It's the right way to go for out country's sake, and if Israel would like to play an allied role, it can be very useful. But if Israel would rather play out its pre-Cold War delusions, then our "sacred bond" can and should be broken.

Yes, the Iran government is bad both for its own people and for the region. It is not, however, crazy. Any attempted attack by Iran on Israel would lead to a massive retaliation which would leave that nation in ruins. Sadly, there is no resolution to this conflict in the short term. Over the long haul, with patience and diplomacy, we can anticipate a collapse of the Iranian regime much in the same way that the corrupt and incompetent Soviet regime fell. There are no swift fixes.

\f0\fs30 \cf0 Netanyahu is war-monger who would like nothing better than to bomb Iran and draw the United States into another bloody war with an uncertain outcome. The President and Secretary Clinton are right in refusing to commit to a "bright line" that would inevitably precipitate a confrontation, and war. 
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 Netanyahu's secondary agenda is to force the U.S. to commit to that bright line, so that the U.S. could not complain when Iran inevitably ignored the warning and Israel bombed Iran.
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 Either way, we lose. Israel rightly fears Iranian nuclear capability, but we have no obligation to follow Israel's preferred plan -- bombing Iran -- for avoiding that outcome. The President's policies, which succeeded in Libya, require international cooperation, diplomacy and, where need be, strategic military intervention. Unilateral bombing is not among those choices and would not achieve the goal -- to stop Iran, without starting a bonfire in the Mid-East.
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 Netanyahu's third agenda, moreover, is to help elect Romney, who like Bush will allow Israel to do whatever it wants to do. We had two Israeli bloody invasions -- of Lebanon and Gaza -- during the Bush administration, -- neither of which accomplished anything but bloodshed.
\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232

\f0\fs30 \cf0 Regardless of the Romney-Netanyahu friendship or even the wisdom of an attack on Iran, an objective look at the situation reveals two facts which defenders of Secretary Clinton must refute: No evidence exists that the sanctions regime, as harmful to the Iranian economy as it may be, has deterred the Iranians from pushing forward with their enrichment program in which they continue to enrich uranium at levels beyond that unnecessary for medical research. Second, by continuing to both publicly announce that Israel will be unable to effectively damage the Iranian program; that Israel should not unilaterally attack; that sanctions are working and that no red lines exist in U.S. policy, the U.S. continues to signal Iran that the U.S. will not take military action. Assuming that Israel should rely on the President 's words opposing containment, Secretary Clinton's remarks nonetheless may be mis-read by the mullahs and.or the revolutionary guard (which may be making policy) as a reluctance by the U.S. to take any military action -- ever. The failure to take any action to support the Green revolution whatever in 2009 would confirm the Iranian perspective. The burden on those who agree with the President's statement that the U.S. will not countenance a nuclear-armed Iran is to explain how Secretary Clinton's comments advance that policy as opposed to convincing the Israelis and Iranians that the U.S. will be reluctant to take any military action.

Mitt Romney has ZERO foreign policy experience, while President Obama has been largely successful on foreign policy in his first term in office.

\f2 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f0 And Iran HAS been attacking Jews around the world for many years now. Bombing Jewish centers in South America and Europe in addition to funding and arming terrorists that have been attacking Israel directly are just the tip of the iceberg. Israel and Iran are at war and have been for some time.

\f0 The actions of the Obama administration are consistent with a policy that is tolerant of a nuclear Iran--despite any protestations to the contrary. Refusing to create any red lines is indicative of this reality. If Obama truly means to use the military to prevent a nuclear Iran, it would have no trouble setting a deadline based on US intelligence assessments. Netanyahu understands that Obama has no intention of supporting a military attack against Iran. The problem is, Obama's telling Iran the same thing.

\f0\fs30 \cf0 I am wondering if perhaps Prime Minister Netanyahu watched a replay of the Democratic National Convention. If so, he saw, or at least heard, the handwriting on the wall. The numbers of those who opposed the changes in the wording of the party's platform startled me, and if the prime minister heard the nays perhaps he was startled, too. If he were not, well, he should have been. Those thundering nays constitute, to the best of my knowledge, the first public outcry against the corrosive influence of the Israel-first lobby in the political life of this country, and, mirabile dictu, that outcry was broadcast not only to the entire nation but to the entire world. Perhaps the prime minister has concluded that the days of Israeli suzerainty are drawing to a close and that he must act quickly or not at all.

\f0 More than half a century has elapsed now since I began to write to my elected representatives in opposition to our support for Israel. Neither crystal ball nor special perception was required to see that uncritical support for Israel was not only immoral but dangerous, yet for five decades and more those of us who held such opinions were simply not heard. Times have changed, though, thanks in large measure to Walt and Mearsheimer, and once I recovered from the shock of hearing all those thundering nays from the Democratic delegates in Charlotte, I began to think for the very first time that, yes, we are, in fact, going to win this battle after all.

I was watching 9/11 footage today from the day it occurred with Palestinians dancing in the street passing out candy, while Israel tried to send over search and rescue groups and aid. Giving a radical country nuclear missiles causes a major problem for us in the region as well. We do send them tax money in the form of different programs and military aid but we also send money to Pakistan and various South American countries who do not like the US at all. If things get out of hand in the Middle East it would be good to have a staging ground for attacks such as Israel. We are not in a position to ostracize one of our only friends in the world.

\f0\fs30 \cf0 As pointed out in this piece, Netanyahu does not even have solid support in Israel for striking Iran. The U.S. is a steadfast ally of Israel, and would not hesitate to intervene should it's own intelligence - underpinned by the IAEA and Israel itself - point to Iran on a "deliberate" and "unalterable" path to developing a nuclear device. Iran knows this, and is not about to enter a suicide pact, especially with their interests threatened in Syria and sanctions forcing them to scramble to sell oil and keep their beleaguered middle-class from taking to the streets once again. The Obama administration has shown a steady hand in orchestrating a measured foreign policy in a manner that strengthens our status on the world scene - and has stated plainly that we will not tolerate a nuclear armed Iran. Bibi would be better served working in tandem with Secretary Clinton, and not trying to impose his hard line on a U.S. goverment that's a repeatedly proven benefactor and protector. Coming in the midst of a presidental campaign makes his remarks seem more political posturing than a genuine declaration of an immediate existential threat. The last thing we need is a reprise of the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld/Wolfowitz/Rice disastors. Let's stay calm, remain vigilent, and strive for reason and mutual trust when it comes to handling the admittedly complex situation in Iran.

Your lack of sensitivity to the incredibly difficult dilemmas facing Israel as Iran gets closer to its nuclear goal is shocking.\
No one suggests that there are easy answers to the challenge. It would have been helpful for The Times at least to acknowledge Israeli concerns:\
\'b6That diplomacy shows no signs of working and is just the most recent Iranian stalling tactic.\
\'b6That Iran is so very close to embedding its nuclear facilities underground, creating a \'93zone of immunity\'94 from attack, that Israel has to worry how much time is left.\
\'b6That there is a degree of uncertainty in Israel about the United States\'92 willingness to take military action against Iran if sanctions do not do the trick.\
Israel is our ally, with existential dangers facing it if Iran should gain a weapon. Putting oneself in Israel\'92s place should be the first order of business in trying to understand and comment on the situation. Unfortunately, this perspective was completely absent from your editorial.\

\f0\fs36 \cf0 \cb8 Your editorial suggests that the Israeli prime minister needs to table the military option and give negotiations more time because there is \'93no proof that Iran is at the point of producing a weapon.\'94 Unfortunately, you fail to provide any evidence that negotiations have any hope of succeeding. Even while the sanctions have dramatically decreased Iran\'92s ability to export oil, the Iranian regime has done a masterful job of dragging out the negotiations while not showing any signs of slowing down the enrichment process or any willingness to compromise.\
Furthermore, Iran continues to call explicitly for Israel\'92s destruction. If you are going to denounce the Israeli government over its willingness to use the military option, you will soon have to come up with a more practical alternative than giving the negotiations more time.\
