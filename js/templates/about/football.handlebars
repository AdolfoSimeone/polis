While the NFL denied the connection between professional football and chronic degenerative diseases such as CTE for years, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/sports/football/actuarial-reports-in-nfl-concussion-deal-are-released.html"> internal actuarial reports now expect that one in three players will be affected.
