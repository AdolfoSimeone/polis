<h1 class="head"> Polis </h1>
<h3 class="subhead"> Communication for groups. </h3> 

<p>Rough draft of subheader before explainer: Broadcast is a solved problem. We built Polis because communicating back to a broadcasting entity is not. </p>

<p> Polis helps users get a comprehensible, sophisticated response from a scalably large, decentralized group - something thus far impossible in the course of human communication. Polis is a web application that leverages real-time connectivity, advanced statistics, machine learning and interactive data visualization to deliver a productive, engaging experience whether users are interacting in person or spread out across the globe. </p> 




<h3> Explainer: What polis is and how polis works in 5 steps </h3>

<h3> 1 </h3> 
<h6> all caps subtitle YOU HAVE A GROUP </h6>
<p> You might be a professor with hundreds of students, a conference speaker with thousands of attendees, a mayor with a city (or any politician at any level of government), a manager with a team of seventy employees, a board chair with ten fellow board members, an activist with a large crowd or an opposition leader with a decentralized crowd that you access online. </p>

<h3> 2 </h3> 
<h6> CREATING A CONVERSATION </h6>
<p> You want to have your group brainstorm, ideate, get their opinions and perspective, see how they feel about an initiative before you launch it, test their knowledge or bring them to consensus. You start a Polis conversation and add a topic or stimulus in any format - text you type, an article for discussion, a video, an audio recording, a photo, or any combination of rich media. </p> 

<h3> 3 </h3> 
<h6> WRITING AND VOTING </h6>

<p> Participants join. All participants are able to submit written comments in reacition to the stimulus. The comments submitted by participants are received and sent back out to all other participants. All participants are able to react to all comments submitted by their peers by agreeing, disagreeing, starring and passing in</p> 

<h3> 4 </h3> 
<h6> REAL-TIME, INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION OF CROWD DYNAMICS </h6>

<p> The Polis application receives all of that data of crowd interaction. We run advanced statistics on it and render an interactive data visualization that shows how users grouped up and what brought them together and separated them.</p> 

<h3> 5 </h3> 
<h6> COMPLETING THE CIRCLE </h6>

<p> We help you understand what happened through the summary view. You realize that there were points of agreement or disagreement that imply follow up, so you start two conversations, using core user comments as part of the stimulus. We help you organize all your conversations in a clean looking dashboard. You discover things you didn't know, and you make better decisions because of it.</p>
