	<h2> Polis in 5 steps </h2>

<h3> 1 </h3> 
<h6> START A CONVERSATION </h6>
<p> You want to communicate with a group. You create a new conversation in Polis and share a link to it however you like - in person on a projecter at a conference, or in an email or a tweet. </p>

<h3> 2 </h3> 
<h6> JOIN & WRITE </h6>
<p> Participants join the conversation using any device that has a browser - smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc. Every participant is able to submit comments in response to a topic or stimulus you've assigned the conversation. </p> 

<h3> 3 </h3> 
<h6> READ & REACT </h6> 
<p> Participants read comments one at a time and react to each by agreeing, disagreeing, passing, starring it (as important) or trashing it (as abusive or off topic). </p> 

<h3> 4 </h3> 
<h6> SEE A REAL-TIME, INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION OF CROWD DYNAMICS </h6>
<p> Everyone in the conversation sees an interactive visalization that groups people closer together if they are agreeing and disagreeing with the same comments, or further apart if they are not. Each participant sees his own position as a red dot.</p> 

<h3> 5 </h3> 
<h6> COMPLETE THE CIRCLE </h6>
<p> We help you understand what's happening by providing tools to navigate and extract meaning from the visualization, as well as simple explanations of what brought groups together, what each found important and what they're still wrestling with. You realize that there were points of agreement or disagreement that imply follow up, so you start new conversations, using core user comments as part of the stimulus. We help you organize all your conversations in a clean dashboard. You discover things you didn't know, and you make better decisions because of it.</p>
