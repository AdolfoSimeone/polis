what would it mean for 500 people to be able to communicate fluidly with one person? seriously, we haven't solved that yet? what would that change?

how polis works:

1. someone broadcasts
2. everyone receives
3. everyone responds
4. everyone rates each other's responses
5. polis clusters people into groups using complex statistical techniques for multidimensional datasets based on who liked what
6. everyone watches a live visualization of groups form
7. users find themselves in a group with a worldview, the person who broadcasts has a clear idea of who is where and what they think.
