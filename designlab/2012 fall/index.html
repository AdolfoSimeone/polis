		<p> Despite astounding advances in human communication, there remains a glaring, unsolved problem: it's hard to get a big group to talk productively about complex topics. Polis provides a platform that helps decentralized groups: 
			<ol class="smallertext">
				<li> <span> emerge </span> and <span> distinguish </span> themselves from other groups </li>
				<li> <span> synthesize </span> their ideas </li> 
				<li> <span> define </span> their values and beliefs in meaningful and enduring ways </li>
				<li> <span> identify </span> the factual basis for those values and beliefs </li> 
				<li> <span> communicate </span>with other groups </li>  
				<li> <span> propose </span> and <span> mobilize </span> actions </li>  
			</ol>

		<p>To imagine how Polis works, consider a large college classroom of 500 students. The professor asks a stimulating, open ended question after the students have read a timely and contentious article. Students respond with text comments on their personal devices (mobile & laptop). The students' comments are sent out randomly to be upvoted or downvoted by their peers. Students who show similar voting patterns are grouped together to repeat the process and synthesize their ideas. A live data visualization shows the groups and their output, so both professor and students can see them form and change in real time.</p> 

		<p>Then consider that same pattern at larger scales of tens or hundreds of thousand on the website of a major newspaper. Begin with a curated set of articles, op-eds, editorials, photographs, short documentary clips, expert opinion and user comments that demonstrates multiple perspectives on an issue of real substance, such as charter schools or financial reform. Users upvote and downvote, comment, group and ultimately register their opinion in an orderly way that is both visual and enduring. </p>

		<p class=""> Polis is composed of a small, professional team of web developers and data scientists. We are driven by a deep belief that ideas are important and that novel technological structures have the power to impose lasting changes on human behavior. Data visualization, machine learning, crowdsourcing, human computer symbiosis & distributed computing get us excited. So do Node, Meteor, Mongo, Neo4js, Mustache, Heroku & AWS, R, D3, Redis, Twitter Bootstrap & jQuery.
