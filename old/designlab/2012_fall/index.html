		<p> One person sending an email to 500 people works just fine. Low complexity, high comprehension. 500 people hitting the reply button? Input overload - high complexity, low comprehension. This same problem crops up in all manner of human communication - education, internal business communications & market research, politics, professional communities & conferences, families, etc. Polis is a communication structure made of beautiful math that leverages crowdsourcing and data visualization to make largescale conversations possible. What's that mean? It means you can feel free to think big with your communications. Go ahead, ask your town something, Mr. Mayor. Rather than a flood of letters and calls, Polis redirects messages back to users who will agree or disagree with their peers, then cluster based on their responses. You'll receive one neat package clearly summarizing the main groups and the ideas that brought them together. Awesome.

		But Polis isn't just for individuals, really, at its core, Polis is about groups. It's hard to get large groups to talk productively about complex topics. Polis provides a platform that helps decentralized groups: </p>
			<ol class="smallertext">
				<li> <span> emerge </span> and <span> distinguish </span> themselves from other groups </li>
				<li> <span> synthesize </span> their ideas </li> 
				<li> <span> define </span> their values and beliefs in meaningful and enduring ways </li>
				<li> <span> identify </span> the factual basis for those values and beliefs </li> 
				<li> <span> communicate </span>with other groups </li>  
				<li> <span> propose </span> and <span> mobilize </span> actions </li>  
			</ol> 
	
		<p> Polisapp.org accomplishes this by: </p>
			<ol class="smallertext">
				<li> <span>curating</span> credible resources and diverse opinions </li> 
				<li> <span> restricting </span> users from directly communicating with one another </span> </li>
				<li> leveraging <span>real-time data visualization</span> to illuminate groups and patterns </li> 
			</ol>

		<p>To imagine how Polis works, consider a large college classroom of 500 students. The professor asks a stimulating, open ended question after the students have read a timely and contentious article. Students respond with text comments on their personal devices (mobile & laptop). The students' comments are sent out randomly to be upvoted or downvoted by their peers. Students who show similar voting patterns are grouped together to repeat the process and synthesize their ideas. A live data visualization shows the groups and their output, so both professor and students can see them form and change in real time.</p> 

		<p>Then consider that same pattern at larger scales of tens or hundreds of thousand on the website of a major newspaper. Begin with a curated set of articles, op-eds, editorials, photographs, short documentary clips, expert opinion and user comments that demonstrates multiple perspectives on an issue of real substance, such as charter schools or financial reform. Users upvote and downvote, comment, group and ultimately register their opinion in an orderly way that is both visual and enduring. </p>

		<p class=""> Polis is composed of a small, professional team of web developers and data scientists. We are driven by a deep belief that ideas are important and that novel technological structures have the power to impose lasting changes on human behavior. Data visualization, machine learning, crowdsourcing, human computer symbiosis & distributed computing get us excited. So do Node, Meteor, Mongo, Neo4js, Mustache, Heroku & AWS, R, D3, Redis, Twitter Bootstrap & jQuery.
