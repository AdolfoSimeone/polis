# polismath - the math module!

Welcome to teh mathz.

Let's use the [github issues](https://github.com/metasoarous/polismath/issues) for discussing issues -- both technical and theoretic -- and the [github wiki](https://github.com/metasoarous/polismath/wiki/_pages) for collating/synthesizing this and other useful information.

## Usage

To get running, install leinengen 2.
From there you should be able to do `lein deps` followed by `lein run -m storm-spec` and see things happening.
For more information on using clojure/leiningen, see [the wiki page](https://github.com/metasoarous/polismath/wiki/Working-with-clojure).
