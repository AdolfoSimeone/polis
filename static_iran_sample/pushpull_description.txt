A push is a dignified response, a pass is not. A push says "this defines my position in the sense that it is what I do not think." A pass says "this does not relate to my position in any way" and is really like no reaction. It could be because it is poorly argued, doesn't make a point, doesn't deserve physical

	Individuals identify themselves as much by what they believe as what they don't. Left over are the passes. If someone types "asdfas;dlkfjas;dlfkj", that's a pass. If someone talks about their grandmother's cooking in the middle of a heated discussion about the ecological tradeoffs associated with desalinization... that's a pass. If someone goes off on a long ass tangent you don't feel like reading - that's a pass and hopefully they'll dial it in next time. If someone's being a jerk or a troll, that could be either a push or a pass depending on the situation. If the conversation is on the middle east and someone makes an anti-islamic comment, you should push if it offends you. But if you're in the middle of a conversation about  "this has no place here."







xkcd readers version: 
Through pushes and pulls you are setting your RELATIVE POSITION to the argument in a visual-spacial sense, albeit an n-dimensional spacial sense. Only pull and push comments that you find relevant to the discussion, and note that your actions will shape the discussion by adding values in an n-dimensional space to those comments.
